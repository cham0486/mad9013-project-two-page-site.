        <!-- Article Intro Section -->
        <section class="article-intro">
            <p>One-shots are snack-sized adventures that allow you to get right into the action of Dungeons & Dragons without the baggage that comes with an extended campaign. In addition, the self-contained nature of one-shots enables players and Dungeon Masters to more easily experiment with the breadth of options D&D provides without commitment. Maybe you want to play as a party of meme characters, complete with janky multiclassing shenanigans? Or perhaps your DM wants to try their hardest to brutally kill the characters one by one? Whatever avenue you're looking to explore with your one-shot, it can make for a fun night of gaming!</p>
            <p>In this article, we're paying homage to one-shot adventures in D&D. We'll discuss why we love them, some tips for running them, and our favorite one-shot adventures!</p>

            <h2>What Is a One-Shot?</h2>
            <p>One-shots are D&D adventures that can be finished in one 3-4 hour session. These adventures are more streamlined because of the tight turnaround time. One-shot adventures are usually meant to be self-contained, not needing any context from outside of the adventure to be run.</p>

            <h3>Why We Love One-Shots</h3>
            <p>One-shots are a casual way to get a session of D&D in without the legwork that comes with a campaign. Players can try out new builds and personalities, while DMs don't have to worry about managing a campaign, keeping notes, or writing a continuous narrative.</p>
            <p>Seeing as one-shots lack the commitment of an extended campaign, they provide a number of unique benefits:</p>
            
            <h4>Switch Up the Group Dynamic</h4>
            <p>One-shots are the perfect time to allow aspiring DMs at your table to step up for a session. While long-term campaigns might be daunting for a new DM, one-session adventures that don't require as much backstory, planning, and management are excellent ways to gain experience. One of the most prominent benefits of this is that it gives your table's "forever DM" a break.</p>

            <h4>Try New Things</h4>
            <p>If you're anything like me, you have 10 janky character builds ready to go at all times. One-shots are the perfect time to try out your new creations without the stakes of being stuck with the same character for 100 sessions (or until they meet their untimely demise).</p>

            <h4>Play D&D Without the Strings</h4>
            <p>Agreeing to play D&D usually comes with a commitment. If your group can't dedicate a night every week (or two … or four … or eight) to D&D, one-shots are the perfect option to get some game time while you have everyone together. If you're hanging out with friends and looking for something to do, a one-shot is much easier to put together than a campaign!</p>

            <h4>Enjoy a Themed Play Experience</h4>
            <p>One-shots work particularly well for the over-the-top spooky or goofy themes these celebrations often inspire. While these grandiose tropes would get tiresome over the course of an extended campaign, one-shots are often the perfect dose of festive holiday spirit!</p>

            <h3>Tips for Running One-Shots</h3>

            <p>While they may not have as many gears as a full-blown campaign, one-shots can be deceptively tricky to run well. Here are some tips to help you run an excellent one-shot:</p>
            
            <h4>Keep the Intro Short</h4>
            <p>When time is of the essence, introducing characters and establishing the story needs to be fast-forwarded compared to a long-term campaign. If it takes the party an hour to describe their characters, decide if they want to work together, then negotiate their contract, you'll probably have to cut things from your planned adventure.</p>

            <h4>Expedite Combat</h4>
            <p>The best way to reduce the time investment required for combat is to set a "retreat scenario" for the party's opposition. Maybe the bandits your party is facing will run if their leader is killed? Or perhaps an owlbear with less than half of its hit points can be scared away with a Charisma (Intimidation) check?</p>

            <h4>Vary the Play</h4>
            <p>One-shots should visit all aspects of D&D play—combat, exploration, and social interaction—to ensure that players are given a chance to make their character feel effective.</p>
